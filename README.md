## Overview
The Productivity Predictor is a machine learning application designed to predict the productivity levels in the garments industry. The project includes a web interface built with Django and Flask, allowing users to input relevant features and receive productivity predictions.

### Live Demo
Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://productivity-predictor.onrender.com/).

## Features
- ðŸ“ˆ Predict productivity based on input features.
- ðŸ’» User-friendly web interface for data input and prediction results.

## Installation
To get started with the Productivity Predictor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/VarshaLenin12/Productivity_Predictor.git
    cd Productivity_Predictor
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Input the required features and click on the "Predict" button to get the productivity prediction.

## Model
The machine learning models used in this project include a regression model and a classification model:

- **Regression Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Classification Model**: XGBoost

### Key Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy in predictions.
- **R-squared Value**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- **Features**: Various factors influencing productivity.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
